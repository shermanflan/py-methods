"""
Finds minimum distance in a graph with positive edges (w(e) >= 0).
This algorithm is undefined for negative-weight paths.

An example of a "greedy" algorithm which solves the problem at hand
by repeatedly selecting the best choice from among those available
in each iteration. Greedy approaches are useful when trying to
optimize some cost function over a collection of objects.
